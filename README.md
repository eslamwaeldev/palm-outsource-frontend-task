## Design decisions

- The colors and font were inspired by Palm Outsourcing color palette and website
- I used the id of the mood to highlight it when the user clicked it

## Improvements

- I would improve the tablet navbar drawer
- I would improve the mood chooser component experience by making the icon also change color
